      <p class="infoParagraph">Hello, my name is Kaven, and I am a student at Stouffville District Secondary School. This
      is my first webpage and first experience with HTML and CSS. I provoundly enjoy mathematics and music. I enjoy
      these subjects so much so that I participate in after school programs such as repertoire. I aspire to become a
      computer scientist despite having no experience whatsoever. My fondness for computer science likely comes from my
      addiction to video games. With this course, I wish to obtain basic knowledge and skill in the art of computer
      science. </p>

      <p class="infoParagraph2">Tests, quizzes, projects, assignments and other forms of term summative evaluations will
      occur throughout the academic year and at the end of units of work as outlined in the accompanying course outline.
      Students will be provided with reasonable opportunities to master skills relating to the achievement of the
      curriculum expectations before assessment and evaluation occurs. Major evaluations will be announced at least one
      week in advance. Accommodations will be made for school activities, statutory holidays, religious days, cultural
      days, sports events and other occurrences that may impact on any scheduled evaluation. It is the student’s
      responsibility to notify teachers of such absences in advance and to make up missed work. Absence on the day of an
      evaluation must be documented. If a student must miss an evaluation, s/he is expected to: A.Notify the teacher
      before the absence to arrange for an alternative date to make up the evaluation; or B.In case of illness or
      unexpected absence, present a note to the teacher, signed by a parent or guardian, immediately upon their return
      to explain the absence. An alternate evaluation will then be scheduled at a mutually convenient time. The Late
      Policy applies to all assignments and evaluations and will be discussed in class. Cheating will not be tolerated
      and will be dealt with appropriately.</p>
